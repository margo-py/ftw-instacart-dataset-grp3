# üìù Instacart Dataset ELT Pipeline Documentation Group 3

## 1. Project Overview

* **Dataset Used:**
  [Instacart Market Basket Analysis (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis)
  The dataset contains anonymized customer orders, products, aisles, and departments from Instacart‚Äôs online grocery platform.

* **Goal of the Exercise:**
  Transform the normalized Instacart dataset (OLTP-style) into a **dimensional star schema** for analytics ‚Äî applying dbt for data cleaning, modeling, and testing, and generating documentation for BI use.

* **Team Setup:**
  Group 3 ‚Äî collaborative setup, with members  **Royce**, **Pau**, **Marj**, **Bianca**, and **Mikay**,.
  Work was done both individually and collaboratively with async updates via Slack and GitHub.

* **Environment Setup:**

  * Development and testing on **Dockerized local environments**
  * Shared **ClickHouse** database
  * dbt project stored and versioned in **GitHub**
  * Visualization in **Metabase**

## 2. Architecture & Workflow

* **Pipeline Flow:**

  ```
  Raw (Bronze) -> Clean (Silver) -> Mart (Gold) -> Metabase Dashboards
  ```

* **Tools Used:**

  * Ingestion: `dlt`
  * Modeling: `dbt`
  * Visualization: `Metabase`
  * Database: `ClickHouse`
  * Documentation & Testing: `dbt docs`, `dbt tests`, `DBeaver`, `dbdiagram`

* **Medallion Architecture Application:**

  * **Bronze (Raw):** Data loaded directly from Kaggle CSVs into ClickHouse (`raw__insta_*` tables)
  * **Silver (Clean):** Data cleaned and standardized via dbt staging models (`stg_grp3_instacart_*`)
  * **Gold (Mart):** Star-schema models for analysis (`fact_` and `dim_` tables)

* **Data Dictionary**

## 3. Modeling Process

* **Source Structure (Normalized):**
  The raw Instacart dataset consists of multiple related tables (orders, order_products, products, aisles, departments) with primary/foreign keys following 3NF design.

* **Star Schema Design:**

  ![ERD](https://github.com/margo-py/ftw-instacart-dataset-grp3/blob/main/dbt/transforms/instacart/Instacart%20Star%20Schema.png?raw=true)

  * **A. Dimension Tables (5):**

    1. `grp3_instacart_dim_aisles`
    2. `grp3_instacart_dim_departments`
    3. `grp3_instacart_dim_products`
    4. `grp3_instacart_dim_time`
    5. `grp3_instacart_dim_users`

  * **B. Fact Tables (2):**

    1. `grp3_instacart_fact_order_products`
    2. `grp3_instacart_fact_orders`

  5. `grp3_instacart_dim_users.sql` -> users dimension

    ```sql

  #### B. Fact Tables
  1. `grp3_instacart_fact_order_products.sql` -> fact order products

    ```sql
    {{ config(materialized='table', schema='mart', engine='mergetree()', order_by='order_id') }}

    select
        cast(op.order_id as integer) as order_id,
        p.product_id as product_id,
        p.aisle_id as aisle_id,
        p.department_id as department_id,
        u.user_id as user_id,
        t.time_id as time_id,
        cast(op.add_to_cart_order as integer) as add_to_cart_order,
        cast(op.reordered as integer) as reordered
    from (
        select * from {{ ref('stg_grp3_instacart_order_products_prior') }}
        union all
        select * from {{ ref('stg_grp3_instacart_order_products_train') }}
    ) as op
    left join {{ ref('grp3_instacart_dim_products') }} as p
        on op.product_id = p.product_id
    left join {{ ref('stg_nrml_grp3_instacart_order_details') }} as od
        on op.order_id = od.order_id
    left join {{ ref('grp3_instacart_dim_users') }} as u
        on od.user_id = u.user_id
    left join {{ ref('grp3_instacart_dim_time') }} as t
        on od.order_dow = t.order_dow
      and od.order_hour_of_day = t.order_hour_of_day
    ```


  2. `grp3_instacart_fact_orders.sql` -> fact orders

    ```sql
    {{ config(materialized='table', schema='mart', engine='mergetree()', order_by='order_id') }}

    select
        cast(o.order_id as integer) as order_id,
        u.user_id as user_id,
        t.time_id as time_id,
        cast(n.order_number as integer) as order_number,
        trim(o.eval_set) as eval_set,
        o.days_since_prior_order as days_since_prior_order
    from {{ ref('stg_nrml_grp3_instacart_order_details') }} as o
    left join {{ ref('stg_nrml_grp3_instacart_order_number') }} as n
        on o.order_id = n.order_id
    left join {{ ref('grp3_instacart_dim_users') }} as u
        on o.user_id = u.user_id
    left join {{ ref('grp3_instacart_dim_time') }} as t
        on o.order_dow = t.order_dow
      and o.order_hour_of_day = t.order_hour_of_day
    ```


* **Challenges / Tradeoffs:**

  * Handling missing `days_since_prior_order` values
  * Ensuring key consistency between `order_products_prior` and `order_products_train`
  * Creating correct primary/foreign key mappings in ClickHouse via dbt
  * Normalizing redundant user and order-level data for clean joins



## 4. Data Quality Checking

In our group, we implemented **two types of data quality checks**:

1. **`schema.yml` tests** ‚Äî *automated dbt-native checks*

   * Focused on **constraints** like:

     * `not_null`
     * `unique`
     * `relationships`
   * Great for enforcing model-level data integrity.

2. **`_data_sanity_check.sql` files** ‚Äî *manual analytical checks*

   * SQL models that summarize DQ metrics in a table
   * Provide **counts**, **descriptions**, and **PASS/FAIL** statuses
   * Ideal for **Metabase dashboards** and ongoing DQ monitoring.

### 1. Schema YAML Quality Check

- üìÇ [Clean Schema YML - Group Github Repository](https://github.com/margo-py/ftw-instacart-dataset-grp3/blob/main/dbt/transforms/instacart/models/clean/schema.yml)
- üìÇ [Mart Schema YML - Group Github Repository](https://github.com/margo-py/ftw-instacart-dataset-grp3/blob/main/dbt/transforms/instacart/models/mart/schema.yml)



### 2. SQL Manual Sanity Check

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ RAW Layer ‚Äì `stg_grp3_data_sanity_check.sql`**

* **Purpose:** Verify raw source files are complete and correctly loaded.
* **Checks done:**

  * Row count per source table
  * Null or blank key fields (IDs, names)
  * Duplicate row detection
  * Uniqueness of primary keys (`aisle_id`, `product_id`, etc.)

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ CLEAN Layer ‚Äì Staging & Normalized Models**

* **Purpose:** Ensure transformation consistency before loading to mart.
* **Checks done:**

  * Data type conversions are valid
  * Foreign key mappings (aisle ‚Üí department, orders ‚Üí users)
  * Removed invalid or duplicate records
  * Structural and referential integrity validation

---

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ MART Layer ‚Äì `grp3_instacart_data_sanity_check.sql`**

* **Purpose:** Validate final analytical tables for accuracy and relationships.
* **Checks done:**

  * `not_null`, `unique`, and `relationship` tests for all dims/facts
  * Domain validation (`reordered` only 0 or 1)
  * PASS/FAIL summary for quick monitoring
  * Referential integrity verification across all dimensions




---

## 5. Collaboration & Setup

* **Task Splitting:**

  All team members were collaboratively in charge of supporting each other across all tasks ‚Äî from data cleaning and modeling to documentation and visualization. 
  
  Coordination was done through two scheduled meetings every Tuesday and Thursday on Slack, along with follow-up huddles, chat sessions, and continuous updates in the shared repository and Google Docs. Communication and progress tracking were maintained through the main Slack channel to ensure alignment and transparency.

* **Shared vs Local Work:**
  Each member worked on local dbt branches, pushed commits to GitHub, and merged updates after cleaning validation.
  Used Slack for async collaboration and meeting coordination.

* **Best Practices Learned:**

  * Commit frequently and pull before push to avoid conflicts
  * Use consistent naming conventions (`stg_`, `fact_`, `dim_`)
  * Define schema.yml and sources.yml for better lineage in dbt docs
  * Test and document every dbt model layer

---

## 6. Business Questions & Insights

* **Business Questions Explored:**

  1. What are the most frequently reordered products?
  2. Which departments or aisles have the highest reorder ratio?
  3. What is the average reorder frequency per customer?
  4. What time of day and day of week are most orders placed?

* **Dashboards / Queries:**

  * Built interactive dashboards in **Metabase** connected to the ClickHouse mart layer
  * Aggregated data from fact tables to show purchase trends by time, product, and user behavior

* **Key Insights:**

  * Majority of orders occur during weekdays, peaking in late afternoons
  * Specific aisles (produce, dairy) show high reorder ratios
  * Repeat customers represent a large share of total orders

---

## 7. Key Learnings

* **Technical Learnings:**

  * dbt project structure and schema testing
  * YAML-driven documentation and tests
  * Basic ClickHouse‚Äìdbt integration setup
  * Use of `dbt docs generate` for automated documentation

* **Team Learnings:**

  * Effective collaboration using GitHub and Slack
  * Version control and multi-environment workflow management
  * Clarity gained from consistent model naming and modular SQL

* **Real-World Connection:**
  Mirrors how real data teams maintain layered data warehouses with CI/CD and documentation standards using dbt, Airflow, and BI tools.

---

## 8. Future Improvements

* **Next Steps with More Time:**

  * Add orchestration using Airflow or Prefect
  * Include data validation via `Great Expectations` -> This is something we discovered where we can check here more advanced data validations (ranges, thresholds, null ratios, value patterns).
  * Automate nightly ETL runs
  * Expand dashboards to include product affinity and retention analytics

* **Generalization:**

  * The same workflow can be applied to e-commerce, retail, or supply chain datasets following the medallion (raw-clean-mart) architecture.
